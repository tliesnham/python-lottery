# python-lottery

A simple Python simulation to showcase just how difficult it is to win the National Lottery in the U.K.

The program generates your ticket with six numbers between 1-59. It then runs your numbers over one million draws (the equivalent of playing for almost 10,000 years!!) to see whether your numbers come up. Thus far I have been unsuccessful.
