# python-lottery

A simple Python simulation to showcase just how difficult it is to win the National Lottery in the U.K.

The program generates your ticket with six numbers between 1-59. It then compares your ticket to simulated lottery draws thousands of times a second. Just running this program for a minute is equivalent to years worth of lottery draws.
